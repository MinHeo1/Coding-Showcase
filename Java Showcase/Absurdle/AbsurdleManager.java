// This program creates a new game of absurdle. A play on the game wordle, the program
// chooses a word with a given length and the user has to guess it. However, the twist
// is that the program changes the word based off of how many options there are available.
// The program has a list of words it chooses from and groups them by pattern (the letters
// that the words have). It then continues to choose the group with the most words until
// either the user guesses the word or the user loses the game. During the game, the
// program continues to give the user feedback. It gives a green square for every letter
// that is in the right spot and the right letter, a yellow square for a right letter in
// a wrong spot, and a gray square for a wrong letter.
