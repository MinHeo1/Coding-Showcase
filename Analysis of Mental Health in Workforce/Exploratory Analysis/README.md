# Domain of Interest - Mental Health
1. Our group chose this domain because of how prevalent mental health issues. In tandem with this, only recently has mental health taken priority with many and many people still disregard it as "faking it" or "lying". Mental health can affect anybody from children to adults, making it a wide scope issue that should be addressed. It is also an underlying issue for a plethora of other issues (such as suicide) so researching the impact and rates of mental health could lead to other discoveries.
2. Related to this domain, we have found research in:         
  * [improving personalized care for mental health](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/data-driven-insights-for-more-effective-personalized-care-in-online-mental-health-interventions/). This research project found how prevalent mental health issues are, and is attempting to found out how to improve client engagement.
  * [how technology affects mental healthcare](https://reform.uk/research/making-right-choices-using-data-driven-technology-transform-mental-healthcare). There is no doubt technology has improved aspects of healthcare (such as mental health apps) but everyone is different and solutions need to be nuanced and complex. This is what this project focuses on, how to minimize repetitive tasks while improving direct patient care.
  * [wearable tech that provides mental health therapy](https://medium.com/mathworks/wearable-tech-provides-data-driven-mental-health-therapy-b1b7ed957ac1). The wrist band provides data-driven therapy that uses up-to-date research in psychology and AI. Although it is generalized (only detects 4 types of emotions), it still focuses on mental health. After taking in emotions, it outputs certain exercises to help the patient. Although still lacking in some features (such as nuance and complexity), it is incredible to see how far technology has come.
3. Some questions that we hope to answer using this domain is:
  * Does working cause an increase in mental Health issues compared to other issues (such as familial issues, injury, etc.)? And if so, what are the implications that can be drawn?
  * What are the rates of suicide in different age groups? What are the underlying causes of these and do they have access to resources (also dependent on their country)?
  * What industry contributes most to mental health issues? Is it variable or is there a reason as to why particular industries suffer from increased rates of mental health issues?

The dataset contains 34 columns and 10980 rows. Questions:
* What are the rates of suicide in different age groups? What are the underlying causes of these and do they have access to resources (also dependent on their country)?

This data set was downloaded from Kaggle, a dataset sharing website. The data was uploaded and collected by Khanna, a user on Kaggle. The data is about overall mental health support availibility, and suicide rates of different age groups in different countries. There are 29 different columns, and 183 rows. Some questions that can be answered using this dataset:
* What are the rates of suicide in different age groups? What are the underlying causes of these and do they have access to resources (also dependent on their country)?
